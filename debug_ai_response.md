# AI Response Debug Guide

## Issue: AI Response Generated but Not Shown in Chat

### Debugging Steps:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for these key log messages:
   - `âœ… AI message saved successfully with ID: [id]`
   - `ðŸ”„ ChatWindow: Messages updated - Total count: [number]`
   - `ðŸ“¨ Current messages in state:`

2. **Common Issues**:
   - **RLS Policy Error**: Check for error code `42501` or policy-related messages
   - **State Update Issue**: Messages not being added to React state
   - **Database Insert Failure**: AI message not saved to database

3. **Debug Points to Check**:
   - Is LM Studio response being extracted correctly?
   - Is `sendMessage(aiResponse, true)` returning a valid result?
   - Are messages being added to the React state?
   - Is the UI re-rendering with new messages?

### Enhanced Logging Added:
- Detailed AI response extraction logging
- Database operation success/failure tracking
- React state update monitoring
- RLS policy error detection
- Message rendering debugging

### Test Commands:
- Use "Test Response" button to test LM Studio connectivity
- Use "Test DB Insert" button to test database insertion
- Check browser console for detailed logs
